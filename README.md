# My students information system that uses tree structure 

Student Information System is a basic Java console application which has been created in order to help student records management. To this end, it employs the binary search tree (BST) to search and store the studentâ€™s records based on ID numbers.

# what it can do:
1.Add Student: Insert a new student into the tree. The application ensures that no duplicate IDs are allowed.

2.Search for a Student: Quickly locate a student record by their unique ID number

3.Display All Students: Show a sorted list of all students based on their IDs.

4.Exit: Safely terminate the application.

why I created this application because it serves as an example about data structure which it helps by its abilities to efficiently manage data in a ordered way,which it makes searching and displaying students information faster and it illustrates how data structure can be applied in everyday tasks. 

For me creating this application help me understand more about binary search trees(BST) which it gave me valuable skills and life lessons that can contribute to my life and also to my community.
